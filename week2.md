# Week 2 Project Report (2019-09-05)

## Timesheet

We've chosen Toggl as our means of tracking time spent on the project. It
allows us to clock in and out when we start and end working periods, and
it also lets us retroactively edit and add times if we forget to record
it in the moment. Here is a view of the time we spent on the project in
Week 2.
